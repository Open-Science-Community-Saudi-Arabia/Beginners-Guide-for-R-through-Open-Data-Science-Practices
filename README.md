This repository was imported directly from [the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/) corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons with minor modifications. 

**The workshop is organised by Metagenomics-based Drug Discovery Lab (MBDD) and [Women Empowerment Department (TDM)](https://www.ksau-hs.edu.sa/English/Vice-Presidency/VPFA/Pages/TDM.aspx) in KSU-HS. Materials are designed by the [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia](https://osc-ksa.com/). It‚Äôll be delivered by instructors and facilitators from ArabR,  Carpentries in MENA and SSBCB.**

### Learning outcomes:

- Learn what an Integrated Developing Environment is
- Learn to work in the R console interactively
- Learn how to generate a reproducible code notebook with R Markdown
- Understand that R Markdown notebooks foster literate programming, reproducibility and open science.
- Learn how to explore a publically available dataset and manipulate, and visualise the data
- Understand the basics of¬†`git`¬†and its usage in RStudio

### Prerequisites:

- Prior Knowledge of basic programming concepts is needed
- Attending the set-up session and having R/Studio/git installed

This lesson teaches modern R scripting using the `tidyverse` collection of packages, version control and collaboration using `git` and GitHub. Altogether, this provides a foundation for a more Open Science by offering practical ways of analysing data and building workflows and figures in a transparent and efficient manner.
