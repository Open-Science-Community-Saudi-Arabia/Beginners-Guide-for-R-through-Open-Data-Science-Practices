This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. 

This lesson teaches modern R scripting using the `tidyverse` collection of packages, version control and collaboration using `git` and GitHub. Altogether, this provides a foundation for a more Open Science by offering practical ways of analysing data and building workflows and figures in a transparent and efficient manner.
