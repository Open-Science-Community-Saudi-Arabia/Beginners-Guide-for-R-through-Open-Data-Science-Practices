# Introduction

Now you have some experience working with tidy data and seeing the logic of wrangling when data are structured in a tidy way. But 'real' data often don't start off in a tidy way, and require some reshaping to become tidy. The `tidyr` package is for reshaping data. You won't use `tidyr` functions as much as you use `dplyr` functions, but it is incredibly powerful when you need it.

Why is this important? Well, if your data are formatted in a standard way, you will be able to use analysis tools that operate on that standard way. Your analyses will be streamlined and you won't have to reinvent the wheel every time you see data in a different way. 

To make a long story short:
> All messy datasets are messy in their own way but all tidy datasets look alike. 

## Resources

These materials borrow heavily from: 

- [R for Data Science: Relational Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data)
- [R for Data Science: Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering)
- [The original paper on tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)

## Data and packages

We'll use the package `tidyr` and `dplyr`, which are bundled within the `tidyverse` package. 

We'll also be using the Gapminder data we used when learning `dplyr`. We will also explore several datasets that come in `base-R`, in the `datasets` package.


# `tidyr` basics

Remember, from the `dplyr` section, that tidy data means all rows are an observation and all columns are variables.
![](../img/tidy_data.png)

Let's take a look at some examples.

Data are often entered in a *wide* format where each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. 

An example of data in a *wide* format is the `AirPassengers` dataset which provides information on monthly airline passenger numbers from 1949-1960. You'll notice that each row is a single year and the columns are each month Jan - Dec. 

In the R console, type:
~~~
AirPassengers
~~~
{:.language-r}

~~~
     Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
1949 112 118 132 129 121 135 148 148 136 119 104 118
1950 115 126 141 135 125 149 170 170 158 133 114 140
1951 145 150 178 163 172 178 199 199 184 162 146 166
1952 171 180 193 181 183 218 230 242 209 191 172 194
1953 196 196 236 235 229 243 264 272 237 211 180 201
1954 204 188 235 227 234 264 302 293 259 229 203 229
1955 242 233 267 269 270 315 364 347 312 274 237 278
1956 284 277 317 313 318 374 413 405 355 306 271 306
1957 315 301 356 348 355 422 465 467 404 347 305 336
1958 340 318 362 348 363 435 491 505 404 359 310 337
1959 360 342 406 396 420 472 548 559 463 407 362 405
1960 417 391 419 461 472 535 622 606 508 461 390 432
~~~
{: .output}

This format is intuitive for data entry, but less so for data analysis. If you wanted to calculate the monthly mean, where would you put it? As another row? 

Often, data must be reshaped for it to become tidy data. What does that mean? There are four main verbs we'll use, which are essentially pairs of opposites:

- turn columns into rows: `gather()` (tidyr < 1.0.0,
- turn rows into columns (`spread()`),
- turn a character column into multiple columns (`separate()`),
- turn multiple character columns into a single column (`unite()`)

## Explore the gapminder dataset.

Yesterday we started off with the gapminder data in a format that was already tidy. But what if it weren't? Let's look at a different version of those data. 

The gapminder dataset in the *wide* format is on GitHub:[https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/blob/gh-pages/data/gapminder_wide.csv](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/blob/gh-pages/data/gapminder_wide.csv).

First have a look at the data. 

You can see there are a lot more columns than the version we looked at before. This format is pretty common, because it can be a lot more intuitive to *enter* data in this way.

<img src="../img/gapminder_wide_gh.png" width="1000px" />

Sometimes, as with the gapminder dataset, we have multiple types of observed data. It is somewhere in between the purely 'long' and 'wide' data formats: 

- 3 "ID variables": `continent`, `country`, `year`. 
- 3 "observation variables": `pop`,`lifeExp`,`gdpPercap`. 

It's pretty common to have data in this format in most cases despite not having ALL observations in 1 column, since all 3 observation variables have different units. But we can play with switching it to the *tidy*/long* format and *wide* to show what that means (i.e. long would be 4 ID variables and 1 observation variable).


But we want it to be in a tidy way so that we can work with it more easily. So here we go. 

You use `spread()` and `gather()` to transform or reshape data between *wide* to *long* formats.

### Setup

OK let's get going. 

We'll learn `tidyr` in an RMarkdown file within a GitHub repository so we can practice what we've learned so far. You can either continue from the same RMarkdown, or begin a new one. 

**Here's what to do:**

1. Clear your workspace (Session > Restart R)
1. New File > R Markdown..., save it under the `gapminder-wrangle.Rmd` name. 

I'm going to write this outside of a coding chunk in my RMarkdown file:

~~~
Data wrangling with `tidyr`, which is part of the tidyverse. We are going to tidy some data!
~~~
{: .source}

### Load `tidyverse` (which has `tidyr` inside)

First load `tidyr` in an R chunk. You already have installed the tidyverse, so you should be able to just load it like this (using the comment so you can run `install.packages("tidyverse")` easily if need be):

~~~
library(tidyverse) 
~~~
{: .language-r}

## `gather()` data from wide to long format

<img src="../img/rstudio-cheatsheet-reshaping-data-gather.png" width="400px" />

### Data import
Read in the data from GitHub. Let's also read in the gapminder data (tidy format) so that we can use it to compare later on. 

~~~
## wide messy format
gap_wide <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/gh-pages/data/gapminder_wide.csv')

## long tidy format
gapminder <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/gh-pages/data/gapminder.csv')
~~~
{:.language-r}

Let's have a look:
~~~
head(gap_wide)
str(gap_wide)
~~~
{:.language-r}

While wide format is nice for data entry, it's not nice for calculations. Some of the columns are a mix of variable (e.g. "gdpPercap") and data ("1952").  What if you were asked for the mean population after 1990 in Algeria? Possible, but ugly. But we know it doesn't need to be so ugly. Let's tidy it back to the format we've been using. 

> ## Discussion point
>
> **Question**: let's talk this through together. If we're trying to turn the `gap_wide` format into `gapminder` format, what structure does it have that we like? And what do we want to change?
>
> > ## Solution
> > - We like the continent and country columns. We won't want to change those. 
> > - We want 1 column identifying the variable name (`tidyr` calls this a **'key'**), and 1 column for the data (`tidyr` calls this the '**value'**).
> > - We actually want 3 different columns for variable: `gdpPercap`, `lifeExp`, and `pop`.
> > - We would like year as a separate column. 
>{: .solution}
{: .discussion}


Let's get it to long format. We'll have to do this in 2 steps. The first step is to take all of those column names (e.g. `lifeExp_1970`) and make them a variable in a new column, and transfer the values into another column. Let's learn by doing:

Let's have a look at `gather()`'s help: 
~~~
?gather
~~~
{:.language-r}  


> ## Discussion point
>
> Question: What is our **key-value pair**? 
{: .discussion}


We need to name two new variables in the key-value pair, one for the key, one for the value. It can be hard to wrap your mind around this, so let's give it a try. Let's name them `obstype_year` and `obs_values`.   


Here's the start of what we'll do: 
~~~
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values)
~~~
{:.language-r}

Although we were already planning to inspect our work, let's definitely do it now:

~~~
str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
~~~
{:.language-r}

We have reshaped our dataframe but this new format isn't really what we wanted.

What went wrong? Notice that it didn't know that we wanted to keep `continent` and `country` untouched; we need to give it more information about which columns we want reshaped. We can do this in several ways.

One way is to identify the columns is by name. Listing them explicitly can be a good approach if there are just a few. But in our case we have 30 columns. I'm not going to list them out here since there is way too much potential for error if I tried to list `gdpPercap_1952`, `gdpPercap_1957`, `gdpPercap_1962` and so on. But we could use some of `dplyr`'s awesome helper functions — because we expect that there is a better way to do this!

~~~
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         dplyr::starts_with('pop'),
         dplyr::starts_with('lifeExp'),
         dplyr::starts_with('gdpPercap'))  #here i'm listing all the columns to use in gather

str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
~~~
{:.language-r}

Success! And there is another way that is nice to use if your columns don't follow such a structured pattern: you can exclude the columns you *don't* want. 
**This is actually what I'd recommend in most cases (less error-prone and simpler to understand).**

~~~
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country)

str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
~~~
{:.language-r}

### Recap: 

Inside `gather()`, we first name the new column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`) and the name for the new amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`), then the names of the old observation variable. We could have typed out all the observation variables, but as in the `select()` function (see `dplyr` lesson), we can use the `starts_with()` argument to select all variables that starts with the desired character string. Gather also allows the alternative syntax of using the `-` symbol to identify which variables are not to be gathered (i.e. ID variables).

### From messy to tidy: final steps

OK, but we're not done yet. `obstype_year` actually contains two pieces of information, the observation type (`pop`,`lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`. We can use the `separate()` function to split the character strings into multiple variables.

`?separate` --> the main arguments are `separate(data, col, into, sep ...)`. So we need to specify which column we want separated, name the new columns that we want to create, and specify what we want it to separate by. Since the `obstype_year` variable has observation types and years separated by a `_`, we'll use that. 

~~~
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) %>%
  separate(obstype_year,
           into = c('obs_type','year'),
           sep = "_",
           convert = TRUE) #this ensures that the year column is an integer rather than a character
~~~ 
{:.language-r} 

No warning messages...still we inspect:
~~~
str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
~~~ 
{:.language-r}
Excellent. This is long format: every row is a unique observation. Yay!

## Plot long format data

The long format is the preferred format for plotting with `ggplot2`. Let's look at an example by plotting just Canada's life expectancy.

~~~
canada_df <- gap_long %>%
  filter(obs_type == "lifeExp",
         country == "Canada")

ggplot(canada_df, aes(x = year, y = obs_values)) +
  geom_line()
~~~ 
{:.language-r}

We can also look at all countries in the Americas:

~~~
life_df <- gap_long %>%
  filter(obs_type == "lifeExp",
         continent == "Americas")

ggplot(life_df, aes(x = year, y = obs_values, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
~~~ 
{:.language-r}

### Your turn

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


### Additional customization
We can use the `scale_colour_brewer` from the `ggplot2` package to change the colour scheme of our plot.   
From the help page of the function: 
> The brewer scales provides sequential, diverging and qualitative colour schemes from ColorBrewer. These are particularly well suited to display discrete values on a map. See [http://colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org) for more information.

~~~
# (re)create an object that stores averages of life expectancy per continent and per year
continents <- gap_long %>%
  filter(obs_type == "lifeExp",
  year > 1980) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_le = mean(obs_values)) %>%
  ungroup()

# plot
ggplot(data = continents, aes(x = year, y = mean_le, color = continent)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Mean life expectancy",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Age (years)",
       color = "Continent") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_colour_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1")  
~~~ 
{:.language-r}


## `spread()`: from long to wide format 

The function `spread()` is used to transform data from long to wide format.

Alright! Now just to double-check our work, let's use the opposite of `gather()` to spread our observation variables back to the original format with the aptly named `spread()`. You pass `spread()` the key and value pair, which is now `obs_type` and `obs_values`.

![](../img/rstudio-cheatsheet-reshaping-data-spread.png)

~~~
gap_normal <- gap_long %>% 
  spread(obs_type, obs_values)
~~~
{:.language-r}

No warning messages is good...but still let's check:

~~~
dim(gap_normal)
dim(gapminder)
names(gap_normal)
names(gapminder)
~~~
{:.language-r}

Now we've got a dataframe `gap_normal` with the same dimensions as the original `gapminder`.

### Your turn

## Recap: the complete RMarkdown notebook 

Spend some time cleaning up and saving `gapminder-wrangle.Rmd`
Restart R. In RStudio, use *Session > Restart R*. Otherwise, quit R with `q()` and re-launch it.

This session RMarkdown notebook .Rmd could look something like this: 

~~~
## load tidyverse
library(tidyverse) 

## load wide data
gap_wide <- readr::read_csv('https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/blob/gh-pages/data/gapminder_wide.csv')

head(gap_wide)
str(gap_wide)

## practice tidyr::gather() wide to long
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) 
# or 
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         dplyr::starts_with('pop'),
         dplyr::starts_with('lifeExp'),
         dplyr::starts_with('gdpPercap'))

## gather() and separate() to create our original gapminder
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) %>%
  separate(obstype_year,
           into = c('obs_type','year'),
           sep="_")

## practice: can still do calculations in long format
gap_long %>% 
  group_by(continent, obs_type) %>%
  summarize(means = mean(obs_values))

## spread() from normal to wide
gap_normal <- gap_long %>% 
  spread(obs_type, obs_values) %>%
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

## check that all.equal()
all.equal(gap_normal,gapminder)

## unite() and spread(): convert gap_long to gap_wide
head(gap_long) # remember the columns

gap_wide_new <- gap_long %>% 
  # first unite obs_type and year into a new column called var_names. Separate by _
  unite(col = var_names, obs_type, year, sep = "_") %>% 
  # then spread var_names out by key-value pair.
  spread(key = var_names, value = obs_values)
str(gap_wide_new)

## `complete()` turns implicit missing values into explicit missing values.

One of the coolest functions in `tidyr` is the function `complete()`. Jarrett Byrnes has written up a [great blog piece](http://www.imachordata.com/you-complete-me/) showcasing the utility of this function so I'm going to use that example here.

We'll start with an example dataframe where the data recorder enters the Abundance of two species of kelp, *Saccharina* and *Agarum* in the years 1999, 2000 and 2004.
~~~
kelpdf <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1999, 2000, 2004, 1999, 2004),
  Taxon = c("Saccharina", "Saccharina", "Saccharina", "Agarum", "Agarum"),
  Abundance = c(4,5,2,1,8)
)

kelpdf
~~~
{:.language-r}

Jarrett points out that *Agarum* is not listed for the year 2000. Does this mean it wasn't observed (Abundance = 0) or that it wasn't recorded (Abundance = NA)? Only the person who recorded the data knows, but let's assume that the this means the Abundance was 0 for that year. 

We can use the `complete()` function to make our dataset more complete.

~~~
kelpdf %>% 
  complete(Year, Taxon)
~~~
{:.language-r}

This gives us an NA for *Agarum* in 2000, but we want it to be a 0 instead. We can use the `fill` argument to assign the fill value.

~~~
kelpdf %>% complete(Year, Taxon, fill = list(Abundance = 0))
~~~
{:.language-r}

Now we have what we want. Let's assume that all years between 1999 and 2004 that aren't listed should actually be assigned a value of 0. We can use the `full_seq()` function from `tidyr` to fill out our dataset with all years 1999-2004 and assign Abundance values of 0 to those years & species for which there was no observation.

~~~

kelpdf %>% complete(Year = full_seq(Year, period = 1),
                   Taxon,
                   fill = list(Abundance = 0))
~~~
