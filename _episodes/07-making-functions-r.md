#  1. Introduction
Functions are at the heart of the R programming language. A lot of analytical steps you will perform in R will be based composed of a series of functions working together.

## 1.1 When to make functions?
- When you repeat yourself many times. Same block of code repeated over and over (copy-paste-mistake pattern).
- When your code becomes very long (e.g. > 50 lines) and it becomes hard to understand the logic behind your code. What are the steps taken?
- When you want to reuse  code over multiple projects over time. Think about a function that makes a plot from the same type of input data, a functiont that performs unit conversion, etc.
-  Why? - When you need to create a series of plots, models that all differ by very few optional arguments (e.g. p-value threhold), etc. 

## 1.2 Function components    

- __Signature:__ the name of the function together with its arguments. 
- __Arguments:__ arguments of your function. This can be accessed using the `?formals(my_function)` or `?args(my_function)`
- __Body:__ function definition (inside curly braces). What your function does. 
- __Environment:__ the variables and objects in R memory that are known to R inside the function.  


## 1.3 A simple example
Here is a simple function that converts the _weight in kilograms_ to its corresponding _weight in pounds_. The conversion rate is taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoirdupois_system).   

~~~
convert_kilogram_to_pound <- function(weight_in_kg) {
  # one pound = 0.45359237 kilogram
  # Sourcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoirdupois_system
  weight_in_pounds <- weight_in_kg / 0.45359237
  return(weight_in_pounds)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

 
> ## Exercise
> Question 1: Apply the `formals()` function to the `convert_kilogram_to_pound` function. What component of the function do you find?  
> Question 2: What does the `body()` function call on `convert_kilogram_to_pound` return? 
> 
> > ## Solution
> > `formals(convert_kilogram_to_pound)` returns the name(s) of the function arguments. Here it returns `weight_in_kg` as it is the only argument. An alternative function is `formalArgs(convert_kilogram_to_pound)`  which only returns the name of the argument as a character.   
> > `body(convert_kilogram_to_pound)` returns the code written inside the `convert_kilogram_to_pound()` function. 
>{: .solution}

## 1.6 Setup

Before we dive further into functions, let's get ready:   
1. First of all, let's clear our current workspace with the ðŸ§¹  
2. Then, let's reload the `tidyverse` suite of packages. 
3. We will also need another package called `rlang`.
4. Finally, let's re-import the gapminder dataset to make sure we work with non-modified data. 

~~~
rm(list = ls()) # similar to the broom. Removes all objects from the current workspace
library("tidyverse")
library("rlang")
gapminder <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/gh-pages/data/gapminder.csv')
~~~

# 2. Steps when building a function

## 2.1 Find a name 

Remember the names of `dplyr` functions?
* `filter` acts on a dataframe rows and _filters_ based on a logic test (`> 0`)
* `select` acts on a dataframe columns and _selects_ columns based on their names for instance. 

These are good names because they are __verbs__ and because they are explicit on what they do. 

> ## What's in a name?
> "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet" (Romeo and Juliette, Shakespeare).  
> Sure! But for functions, naming is essential ðŸ˜Š 
{: .testimonial}

So make sure you give your custom function, a clear distinctive name. 

> ## Exercise
> `lm()` is an example of a badly named function.   
> 1. Find what `lm()` stands for by typing `?lm()`  
> 2. Can you suggest a better name for that function?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. `lm()` stands for linear model. It fits a linear model on some dataset.   
> > 2. A better name could be "fit_linear_model()" for instance. It has a verb and is not an abbreviation.

{: .challenge}

## 2.2 Turn your initial script into the body of a function

Let's see how we can convert our script to plot the GDP per capita per country [section 2.1 of the previous episode](/06-R-programming/index.html#21-one-country)

This is what we had for one country (e.g. "Afghanistan"):

~~~
## filter the country to plot
gap_to_plot <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Afghanistan")

## plot
my_plot <- ggplot(data = gap_to_plot, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  ## add title and save
  labs(title = paste("Afghanistan", "GDP per capita", sep = " "))
my_plot
~~~
{: .language-r}

This will become the body of a new function. 

> ## How shall we call our new function?
> Could you propose a good name for that function? Remember, it has to contain a verb, be relatively short and meaningful.
{: .discussion}

By convention, everything within the body of a function has to be indented. You can add two spaces (space bar x 2) in front of every line. 
Since it is also a good style tip to have indentations after the `%>%` operator ([following the tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html)), you will have a total of 2x2 (4) spaces before some lines. 

~~~
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder <- function(data = gapminder){
 
  gap_to_plot <- data %>%
    filter(country == "Afghanistan")

  ## plot
  my_plot <- ggplot(data = gap_to_plot, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_point() +
    ## add title and save
    labs(title = paste("Afghanistan", "GDP per capita", sep = " "))

  return(my_plot) # optional but explicit on what the function returns
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Exercise
> Take a look at the code of our function. There are two lines of code that need to be generalised. Can you find which ones?
> > ## Solution
> > Line 1: `filter(country == "Afghanistan")`  
> > Line 2: `labs(title = paste("Afghanistan", "GDP per capita", sep = " "))`  
> These two lines are not generic and our function will always plot results for "Afghanistan". 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## 2.3 Add arguments in the function signature 

Since our function has a body but is missing an argument namely `cntry`, let's add it. We will change its name to `country_to_plot` to better reflect its purpose. 

~~~
# define the function
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder <- function(data = gapminder, country_to_plot = "Albania"){
 
  gap_to_plot <- data %>%
    filter(country == country_to_plot)

  ## plot
  my_plot <- ggplot(data = gap_to_plot, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_point() +
    ## add title and save
    labs(title = paste(country_to_plot, "GDP per capita", sep = " "))

  return(my_plot) # optional but explicit on what the function returns
}
# run the function
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder <- function(data = gapminder, country_to_plot = "Albania")
~~~
{: .language-r}

If you would execute this code, it would not work because all `tidyverse` functions are using something called "tidy evaluation" that is a form of non-standard evaluation used mostly by `dplyr` verbs such as `filter`, `select` etc.  

> ## tidy evaluation
> This is clearly outside of the scope of this lesson. If interested, please consult the [related `dplyr` section](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) and this [blog post](https://jessecambon.github.io/2019/12/08/practical-tidy-evaluation.html). 
{: .callout}

Inside the function, the `country_to_plot` expression needs to be first _quoted_ (not evaluated) before being passed to `dplyr` functions. We do this by using the `enquo()` function to capture both expression and its initial environment. 

~~~
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder <- function(data = gapminder, country_to_plot = "Albania"){
  
  # enquo quotes the "country_to_plot" variable and does not evaluate it yet
  country_to_plot = enquo(country_to_plot) # quote
  
  # uncomment if you want to see what enquo(country_to_plot) does inside the function
  # print(country_to_plot)
  
  gap_to_plot <- data %>%
    filter(country == !!country_to_plot) # unquote
  # the bang bang operator !! evaluates the expression in the dplyr filter call
  
  ## plot
  my_plot <- ggplot(data = gap_to_plot, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_point() +
    ## add title and save
    labs(title = paste(as_name(country_to_plot), "GDP per capita"))
  
  return(my_plot) # optional but explicit on what the function returns
}

# execute the function with default arguments
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder()
~~~
{: .language-r}

You should obtain a plot for Albania (default). 

Now, you can easily plot the GDP per capita for a given country. 
~~~
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder(country_to_plot = "Cuba")
plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder(country_to_plot = "France")
~~~

# 3. Functional programming in R - simple case

R is at its core a functional language meaning it applies functions to objects and returns another object. We can use this property to improve our code and get ride of the _for loops_. 

Indeed, _for loops_ are not easy to read and understand since they make use of temporary variables, 

## 3.1 The `map()` function

This example is taken from [Stanford Data Challenge Lab (DCL)](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) course.

Execute this code to get the number of moons per planet as a list:
~~~
moons <-
  list(
    earth = 1737.1,
    mars = c(11.3, 6.2),
    neptune = 
      c(60.4, 81.4, 156, 174.8, 194, 34.8, 420, 2705.2, 340, 62, 44, 42, 40, 60)
  )
~~~
{: .language-r}

Each vector in the list contains the radius of the moons in kilometer. For instance, the Earth moon radius is 1731.1 km. 

To count the number of moons for each planet, we can execute `length()` on each element of the list:  

~~~
length(moons$earth)
length(moons$mars)
length(moons$neptune)
~~~
{: .language-r} 

Not only this is tedious but can be impossible to perform if the `moons` list would contain too many elements. Previously, _for loop_ gave us one solution to do this.  

> ## Exercise
> Can you achieve the same result with a _for loop_?
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > for (i in seq_along(moons)){
> >   print(length(moons[[i]]))
> > }
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-r}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Here, we will see a package called `purrr` that makes this process more straightforward. 

<img src="../img/07-cat-puring.jpg" alt="cat purring" width="400px">

The `map` function takes a vector or a list and a function as its two arguments. 


~~~
# first argument = list of moons' radius
# second argument = function length()
map(moons, length) 
~~~
{: .language-r}

This returns a list. Ideally, a simplified object would be a vector with only 3 values inside (the number of moons per planet). There is a `map()` variant that does precisely that and it is called `map_int()`:

~~~
map_int(moons, length)
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
earth    mars  neptune 
    1       2       14 
~~~
{: .output}


## 3.2 Detailed explanation

The `map()` function takes a list or a vector and a function as its two arguments. 

<img src="../img/07-map-1.png" alt="map explanation 1" height="200px">

`map()` takes each element of the list/vector and applies the function to it. Hence the name "map" since it _maps_ each item of a vector/list to a function. 

<img src="../img/07-map-2.png" alt="map explanation 2" height="200px"> 

<img src="../img/07-map-3.png" alt="map explanation 3" height="400px">

When we applied the `map()` function to the `moons` list with the `length()` function, it returned a list with the length of each item in the moons list. 

## 3.3 `map()` family of functions

We have already seen that the `map()` function comes with variants since we used the `map_int()` function that returns integers.   
When mathematical operations need to be performed, the `map_dbl()` that returns doubles (numeric decimal values) comes in handy. 

Try out:  
~~~
map_dbl(moons, median)
~~~  
{: .language-r}

~~~
earth    mars  neptune 
1737.1   11.3  2705.2 
~~~
{: .output}

This is necessary when the applied function returns doubles/numeric values while the `map()` variant expects integers. If you try this, it will return an error:  

~~~
map_int(moons, median)
~~~
{: .language-r}

The first element returned by median is `1731.1` that is a double. Therefore, it cannot be converted to an integer (1731) without losing information. 
~~~
Error: Can't coerce element 1 from a double to a integer
~~~
{: .output}

Indeed, `map()` comes with a whole family of functions. Check the help manual of `map()`:

~~~
?map()
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[...]
map(.x, .f, ...)

map_lgl(.x, .f, ...)

map_chr(.x, .f, ...)

map_int(.x, .f, ...)

map_dbl(.x, .f, ...)

map_raw(.x, .f, ...)

map_dfr(.x, .f, ..., .id = NULL)

map_dfc(.x, .f, ...)

[...]

Value
map() Returns a list the same length as .x.

map_lgl() returns a logical vector, map_int() an integer vector, map_dbl() a double vector, and map_chr() a character vector.

map_df(), map_dfc(), map_dfr() all return a data frame.
~~~
{: .output}

## 3.4 `map()` applied to gapminder

Using the `map()` function, we can now create a list called `all_plots` that contain all our ggplot figures.

~~~
# We take only the first 10 countries 
countries_to_plot <- unique(gapminder$country)[1:10]

# Create a list that contain our plots
all_plots <- map(
  .x = countries_to_plot, 
  .f = function(x) plot_gdp_percap_from_gapminder(data = gapminder, country_to_plot = x)
  )
~~~
{: .language-r}

To save the plots on the disk, the `map2()` function that takes two input vector/list instead of one. The first vector/list will be the titles of the files while the second vector/list will be the `all_plots` list. 

The two input vector/list have to have the same length. 
~~~
# save plots
map2(.x = paste0(countries_to_plot, ".png"), 
     .y = plots$plot, 
     function(x,y) ggsave(filename = x, plot = y))
~~~
{: .language-r}
